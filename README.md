https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

All data is available on this kaggle site. There are 2 folders: Yes and No. All tumor MRIs are in the Yes folder. Here, I attach my jupyter notebook code. I used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) classifier to detect is it tumor or not. I got 92% accuracy. I also used 3 different types of segmentation methods: Threshold based segmentation, Contour segmentation, HSV based segmentation. Not any of those are perfect for all type of images.
